Registering to vote in Georgia is a straightforward process, but the steps aren't always laid out clearly in one place. This guide covers who's eligible, how to register, what deadlines apply, and what younger Georgians should know about pre-registration.

## Who Can Register

To register to vote in Georgia, you must:

- Be a United States citizen
- Be a legal resident of Georgia and of the county where you're registering
- Be 18 years old by Election Day (see the pre-registration section below if you're 17)
- Not be currently serving a sentence for a felony conviction
- Not have been declared mentally incompetent by a court

If you have a felony conviction but have completed your sentence, including any probation or parole, your voting rights are automatically restored in Georgia. You can register as soon as your sentence is done.

## Three Ways to Register

**Online**

The quickest option is through the Georgia Secretary of State's voter registration portal at [registertovote.sos.ga.gov](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov). You'll need a valid Georgia driver's license or state ID. The process takes about five minutes.

**By Mail**

Download and print Georgia's voter registration form (SEB Form No. 500) from [sos.ga.gov](https://sos.ga.gov/how-to-register-to-vote), fill it out, and mail it to your county board of registrars. The envelope must be postmarked at least 28 days before the election.

**In Person**

You can register in person at several types of locations:

- Your county voter registration office
- A Department of Driver Services (DDS) location
- Public libraries
- Other state and local government offices

Staff at these locations are available to help you with the form if needed.

## Registration Deadlines

Registrations must be received, or postmarked if mailed, **at least 28 days before an election**. This deadline applies no matter how you register.

If you miss the cutoff for an upcoming election, it's still worth registering. Your information will be on file and you'll be set for the next one.

## After You Register

Once your registration is processed, you'll receive a voter registration card by mail listing your assigned polling location. You don't need the card to vote, but keep it for reference. You can also check your registration status and find your polling place through Georgia's My Voter Page at [mvp.sos.ga.gov](https://mvp.sos.ga.gov).

If you move, update your address through the online portal as soon as you can. Voting in the wrong county can result in being issued a provisional ballot.

## If You're 17: Pre-Registration

Georgia allows 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote.

If you will turn 18 on or before Election Day, you can pre-register now. Your name goes into the official voter rolls, and your registration becomes active when you reach voting age. You won't need to re-register.

If the next election falls before your 18th birthday, you can still pre-register. You won't be eligible to vote in that particular election, but your registration stays on file and will be valid for future ones.

Pre-registering at 17 is worth doing early. Many first-time voters miss their first eligible election because they didn't account for the registration deadline. Taking care of it ahead of time removes that obstacle.

To pre-register, use the same online portal or mail-in form. The process is the same as standard registration, and the Secretary of State's office handles eligibility verification automatically.

## Where to Get More Information

Voter registration requirements can change. For the most current information, visit the Georgia Secretary of State's Elections Division at [sos.ga.gov/elections](https://sos.ga.gov/elections-division-georgia-secretary-state).

Your county board of registrars can also answer questions specific to your situation. A directory of county offices is available on the Secretary of State's website.

If you're a student living away from home, you can register using either your home county address or your school address, whichever you consider your primary residence. You cannot be registered at both addresses simultaneously.
