		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Future Voters Academy develops and delivers free, nonpartisan civic education programs for
			residents of low-income neighborhoods. All programs are built on a single principle: every
			person, regardless of economic background, deserves accurate and accessible information
			about how government works and how to participate in it.
		</p>
		<p>
			FVA does not align with any political party or ideology. Our programs present factual
			information drawn from public government sources and established civic education
			organizations.
		</p>

		<h2>Civic Literacy Curriculum</h2>
		<p>
			FVA is developing a structured civic literacy curriculum for use in informal education
			settings such as community centers, after-school programs, and workforce development
			organizations. The curriculum covers foundational knowledge about U.S. government, how laws
			are made, and how citizens can participate beyond voting.
		</p>
		<p>
			The curriculum is designed for adult learners and will be made available to partner
			organizations at no cost upon completion.
