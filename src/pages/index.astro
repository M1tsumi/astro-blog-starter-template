			<h1>Welcome to Future Voters Academy</h1>
			<p>
				Future Voters Academy (FVA) is an unincorporated association dedicated to providing
				<strong>nonpartisan political education</strong> to residents of low-income neighborhoods.
				We believe that every community deserves access to the civic knowledge needed to participate
				fully and confidently in our democracy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our mission is to raise funds and resources that go directly toward educational programs,
				workshops, and materials that empower future voters — regardless of political affiliation —
				to understand their rights, the electoral process, and how government works at every level.
			</p>
			<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
			<p>
				Low-income communities are often underserved when it comes to civic education. FVA exists to
				close that gap. By delivering accessible, unbiased political education, we help build
				informed, engaged citizens who can advocate for themselves and their neighbors.
			</p>
