	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		Future Voters Academy (FVA) is an unincorporated association committed to raising funds for
		nonpartisan political education in low-income neighborhoods across the country. We believe
		that an informed electorate is the foundation of a healthy democracy — and that every person,
		regardless of income or background, deserves access to high-quality civic education.
	</p>

	<h2>What We Do</h2>
	<p>
		FVA organizes workshops, distributes educational materials, and builds community partnerships
		to deliver unbiased information about voting, government structure, civil rights, and the
		electoral process. Our programming is strictly nonpartisan — we do not endorse any candidate,
		party, or political ideology. Our only goal is an informed and empowered community.
	</p>
	<p>
		We target our outreach to low-income neighborhoods that have historically been underserved by
		traditional civic education efforts. By meeting people where they are, we help break down
		barriers to political participation and cultivate the next generation of engaged citizens.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Founder</h2>
	<p>
		Future Voters Academy was founded by <strong>Thomas Cobb</strong>, a dedicated community
		advocate who recognized the critical need for accessible, nonpartisan political education in
		underserved communities. Thomas established FVA with the conviction that civic knowledge is a
		right, not a privilege, and that empowering individuals with that knowledge creates lasting,
		positive change in neighborhoods and beyond.
	</p>

	<h2>Get Involved</h2>
	<p>
		Whether you want to volunteer, donate, or partner with us, we welcome your support. Every
		contribution — large or small — helps us expand our reach and deliver meaningful civic
		education to those who need it most.
