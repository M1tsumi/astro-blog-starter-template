		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>
			Future Voters Academy (FVA) is an unincorporated association committed to raising funds for
			nonpartisan political education in low-income neighborhoods across the country. We believe
			that an informed electorate is the foundation of a healthy democracy. Every person,
			regardless of income or background, deserves access to high-quality civic education.
		</p>
		<p>
			FVA is working toward official recognition as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation so that we
			can expand our programs and access formal grant funding. Your support today helps make that
			possible.

		<h2>Programs and Outreach</h2>
		<p>
			FVA organizes community workshops, distributes educational materials, and builds local
			partnerships to deliver factual, unbiased information about voting, government structure,
			civil rights, and the electoral process. Our programming is strictly nonpartisan. We do not
			endorse any candidate, party, or political ideology.
		</p>
		<p>
			We focus our outreach on low-income neighborhoods that have historically been underserved by
			traditional civic education efforts. By meeting people where they are, we help reduce
			barriers to political participation and support a more engaged and informed citizenry.
