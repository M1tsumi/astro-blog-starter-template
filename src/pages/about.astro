		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>
			Future Voters Academy (FVA) is an unincorporated association committed to raising funds for
			nonpartisan political education in low-income neighborhoods across the country. We believe
			that an informed electorate is the foundation of a healthy democracy. Every person,
			regardless of income or background, deserves access to high-quality civic education.
		</p>
		<p>
			FVA is working toward official recognition as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation so that we
			can expand our programs and access formal grant funding. Your support today helps make that
			possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			FVA is based in southern Georgia and is beginning its programs in Pierce and Ware Counties,
			with a long-term goal of expanding to additional underserved communities across the region
			and the country.
		</p>

	<section>
		<h2>Programs and Outreach</h2>
		<p>
			FVA organizes community workshops, distributes educational materials, and builds local
			partnerships to deliver factual, unbiased information about voting, government structure,
			civil rights, and the electoral process. Our programming is strictly nonpartisan. We do not
			endorse any candidate, party, or political ideology.
		</p>
		<p>
			We focus our outreach on low-income neighborhoods that have historically been underserved by
			traditional civic education efforts. By meeting people where they are, we help reduce
			barriers to political participation and support a more engaged and informed citizenry.

		<h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
		<p>
			Future Voters Academy was founded by <strong>Thomas Cobb</strong>, a community advocate
			from southern Georgia who recognized a critical and persistent gap: residents of low-income
			communities — particularly in rural areas like Pierce and Ware Counties — have historically
			had limited access to the kind of plain-language, nonpartisan civic education that
			empowers people to participate in their own democracy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thomas established FVA on a straightforward conviction: civic knowledge is a right, not a
			privilege. Every person, regardless of income or background, deserves the tools to
			understand how government works, how elections function, and how to make their voice heard.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thomas leads all aspects of FVA's work — from developing accessible educational materials
			to building the community partnerships needed to deliver them. His approach is hands-on and
			community-first: FVA's programs are shaped by real conversations with the residents and
			neighborhoods it serves, not developed in the abstract. He believes that durable civic
			engagement begins locally, and that investing in a community's civic literacy is one of the
			most meaningful things an organization can do.
		</p>
		<p>
			FVA is Thomas's effort to put that belief into practice — starting in the communities he
			knows best and building toward a model that can grow.
