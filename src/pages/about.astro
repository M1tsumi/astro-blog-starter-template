				<h1>About Future Voters Academy</h1>
				<p>futurevotersacademy.org &mdash; An Unincorporated Association</p>
			</div>

			<section>
				<h2>Mission</h2>
				<p>
					Future Voters Academy (FVA) is an unincorporated association committed to raising funds
					for nonpartisan political education in low-income neighborhoods across the country. We
					believe that an informed electorate is the foundation of a healthy democracy — and that
					every person, regardless of income or background, deserves access to high-quality civic
					education.
				</p>
				<p>
					FVA is working toward official recognition as a nonprofit corporation so that we can
					expand our programs and seek formal grant funding. Your support today helps make that
					possible.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Programs &amp; Outreach</h2>
				<p>
					FVA organizes community workshops, distributes educational materials, and builds local
					partnerships to deliver unbiased information about voting, government structure, civil
					rights, and the electoral process. Our programming is strictly nonpartisan — we do not
					endorse any candidate, party, or political ideology.
				</p>
				<p>
					We focus our outreach on low-income neighborhoods that have historically been underserved
					by traditional civic education efforts. By meeting people where they are, we help reduce
					barriers to political participation and cultivate engaged, informed citizens.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Founder</h2>
				<p>
					Future Voters Academy was founded by <strong>Thomas Cobb</strong>, a community advocate
					who recognized the critical need for accessible, nonpartisan political education in
					underserved communities. Thomas established FVA on the conviction that civic knowledge is
					a right, not a privilege.
